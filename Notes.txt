GIT PULL : 

-git pull is shorthand for two commands:

git fetch
git merge
-If you're on akshay branch and you run 'git pull'
It will:
1)Fetch the latest updates from origin/akshay
2)Merge them into your local akshay branch

That why we do git pull origin main.

-git pull origin main /  git pull origin master is it same?
-->Only one of main or master usually exists — use the one your project uses as the default branch.

GIT FETCH : 

Command			What it Does					Merges Changes?
git fetch	Downloads changes from remote without applying them	❌ No
git pull	Downloads and merges changes into your current branch	✅ Yes

- git fetch origin (Just fetches the latest info)
Contacts the remote (origin)
Gets all new commits and branches
Does not touch your working files
You’ll still be on your current branch with no changes applied

🧠 Think of it as:
“Go check what’s new on the server, but don’t touch my local work.

--Common Use Case Example
You're on branch akshay, and want to see what's new in origin/main:

git fetch origin              # fetches updates from remote
git diff origin/main         # shows what's different between your current branch and remote main
Then if it looks good:
git merge origin/main        # apply the changes to your branch


----------------------------------------------

I was on branch bedant. Then imanually added one file sample.txt inside same folder where my project is placed. I can see that text file in bedant. But when i switched to main, there as well I can see the text file. How?
-->
An untracked file is any file in your folder that:
Is not staged
Is not committed
Is not known to Git yet

-Git only switches the tracked/committed files when changing branches.
So:
If a file is untracked → stays visible in all branches
If a file is committed to a branch → only appears in that branch (unless merged or cherry-picked)
